### Introduction
Contains C++ implementation of the following algorithms:
* **tic_tac_toe.cpp:** Using Minimax algorithm, with alpha beta pruning improvement, play a Tic-Tac-Toe game of size 3x3 or 4x4. 
* **expression_evaluation.h:** Evaluation of mathematical expressions involving binary operators, converting between infix and postfix expressions, etc.
* **graph.h:** DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's shortest path.
* **recursion_to_iteration.cpp:** A generic approach to convert a recursive algorithm into an iterative algorithm by approximately simulating a program stack. 
* **disjoint_set.h:** Implementation of Union() and Find() operations on a disjoint datastructure. Useful for cycle detection, common component analysis, etc.
* **select_sort.h:** Select sort algorithm.
* **bubble_sort.h:** Bubble sort algorithm.
* **quick_sort.h:** Quick sort algorithm.
* **merge_sort.h:** Merge sort algorithm.
* **heap_sort.cpp:** Heapsort algorithm based on maxheap.
* **hash.cpp:** Hashtable implementation to store strings as (key, value) pairs.
* **binary_search_tree.cpp:** Create a BST with an integer key, inorder and levelorder traversal algorithms.
